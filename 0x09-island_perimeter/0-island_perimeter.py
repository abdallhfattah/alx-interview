def island_perimeter(grid):

    Calculate the perimeter of the island in the given grid.

    The grid is a 2D list where:
    - 1 represents land
    - 0 represents water

    For each land cell, the perimeter is calculated based on how many sides
    are adjacent to water or the boundary of the grid.

    Args:
    - grid (list of list of int): 2D list where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

    Returns:
    - int: The perimeter of the island in the grid.

    Calculate the perimeter contribution of a single land cell at (row, col).

    A land cell has up to 4 neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). If any of
    these neighbors is water (0) or outside the grid, it contributes to the perimeter.

    Args:
    - row (int): The row index of the current cell.
    - col (int): The column index of the current cell.
    - grid (list of list of int): 2D list representing the map of the island.
